# Get Involved with EOSIO Documentation! 

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the EOSIO platform documentation! We always welcome contributions from our community to make our docs better. 


## How to Contribute

You can either submit a Pull Request for quick edits or file a new docs issue. 

### Quick Edits
Quick edits allow for faster reporting of minor content issues from typographical errors to omissions. 

To make a quick edit:

1. Most of the pages on the EOSIO developer portal provide an **Edit** link which redirects you to the source file on Github. If you don't see the **Edit** button on the documentation page, that means the specific page is not available to be changed. 
2. Go to the specific page where you have identified an editorial need and click the pencil icon at the top right of the page. You have to fork the project and edit the file. 
> If the pencil icon is grayed out, make sure you are logged in to your Github account or create a new account if you don't have one. 
3. Make the suggested changes in the editor. 
4. After suggesting your changes, enter a title and description of the changes you suggested and click **Propose file change**.
5. Create a **Pull Request** by entering a title and a description. 
   > If you are new to Github, see [About Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for more information. 

Congrats! You have submitted your suggestion. Our team will review your pull request and merge it if it's a valid change. 


### Filing a Docs Issue 
Filing an issue in a docs repository means reporting a documentation bug in the form of a Github issue. 

To file a new issue:

1. Go to the specific page where you have identified an area of improvement and click **Request Changes** at the top right of the page. 
2. You will be directed to the Issues tab of the specific documentation repository with an Issue form open. 
   > If you are not currently logged in to Github, log in. 
3. Describe the issue with relevant information and a proposed solution  using Markdown syntax. 
4. Click **Submit new issue** to submit the issue to the repository.
