title: "Testnet"

A testnet is an instantiation of the EOSIO platform that is intended for testing purposes. Generally, the native token has no value and is given away to developers so they can test. Some features of a testnet may be disabled such as consensus and governance.

There are both public and private testnets. As the terminology suggests, a public testnet is open to the public, whereas a private testnet may be deployed by any individual or organization for the purposes of their own internal testing.

One way of looking at a "testnet" is as a "staging server," this staging server could either be exposed to the wild (Public) or kept private (Private).
