A mainnet is a production network instantiated with the EOSIO platform. For a public mainnet, the tokens have value, and all of the features required to run and maintain the network, such as consensus and governance, are enabled. In a private mainnet, the purpose is generally to store data in an immutable fashion, and the data is derived from a production setting.
