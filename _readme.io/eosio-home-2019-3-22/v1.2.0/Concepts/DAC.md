A DAC is an entity that utilizes a combination of automation and with input from stakeholders, normally in the form of votes. They are often governed by code which describes the purpose of the organization.

There are some disputes what DAC can stand for, but ultimately they can all be interchanged. The original origin of DAC is "Decentralized Autonomous Company," but others have used "Decentralized Autonomous Collective" and "Decentralized Autonomous Corporation."
