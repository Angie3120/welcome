  "body": "A signature is generated when signing a data with a [Private Key](doc:private-key). Signatures are required to demonstrate provable ownership and as the authenticity mechanism of a [Transaction](doc:transaction).  Once signed and broadcasted to the network, [Block Producers](doc:block-producer) verify the integrity of the message. If a signed transaction validates and does not conflict with existing state, the transaction is applied to blockchain state."
