title: "Block"
excerpt: ""
---
A confirmable unit of the Blockchain. Each block contains zero or more Transactions, as well as a cryptographic connection to all prior blocks. When a block becomes "irreversibly confirmed" it's because a supermajority of Block Producers have agreed that the given Block contains correct Transactions. Once a Block is irreversibly confirmed, it becomes a permanent part of the immutable Blockchain.
