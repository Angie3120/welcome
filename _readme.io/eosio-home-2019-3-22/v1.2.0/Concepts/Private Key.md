  "body": "A [Digital Signature](doc:signature) is generated when signing a data with a **Private Key**. Signatures are used to demonstrate provable ownership, as well as the authentication mechanism of a [Transaction](doc:transaction).  Once signed and broadcasted to the network, [Block Producers](doc:block-producer) verify the integrity of the transaction. If a signed transaction validates and does not conflict with the blockchain, the transaction is included in the block."
