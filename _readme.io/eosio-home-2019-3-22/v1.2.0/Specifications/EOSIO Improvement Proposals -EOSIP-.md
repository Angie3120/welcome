An EOSIO Improvement Proposal (EOSIP) is a design document, typically describing a new feature for EOSIO with a concise technical specification of the feature and the rationale for it. If you're familiar with BIP and EIP, than you'll be familiar with EOSIP. 

"This is broadly similar to the way in which Internet "Request for Comments" (RFCs) and the Python computer language's "Python Enhancement Proposals" (PEPs) are used."
