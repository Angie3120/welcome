EOSIO documentation enforces several assumptions on the end-user in order to create a more consistent documentation experience.

* **Your development environment exists within some flavor of nix**, this includes Mac OS. The majority of development at the core levels of EOSIO require that the user utilize command line. Windows' `cmd` is an edge case in the computing world, utilizing syntax inspired by DOS not compatible with the vast majority of software in the wild. Until Windows adopts a Linux Platform (it does appear this might happen eventually), we regret to inform you that none of our documentation support windows. If you develop on Windows, you've likely dealt with this in the past, and may possess the skill to take the information provided, and port it for your needs.
