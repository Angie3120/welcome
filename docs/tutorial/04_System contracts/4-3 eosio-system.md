title: "4.3 eosio.system"
excerpt: ""
---
The `eosio.system` contract is another smart contract that Block.one provides an implementation for as a sample system contract.  It is a version of `eosio.bios` only this time it is not minimalist, it contains more elaborated structures, classes, methods, and actions needed for an EOSIO based blockchain core functionality:
- Users can stake tokens for CPU and Network bandwidth, and then vote for producers or delegate their vote to a proxy.
- Producers can register in order to be voted for, and can claim per-block and per-vote rewards.
- Users can buy and sell RAM at a market-determined price.
- Users can bid on premium names.
- A resource exchange system, named REX, allows token holders to lend their tokens, and users to rent CPU and NET resources in return for a market-determined fee.

The actions implemented and publicly exposed by the `eosio.system` system contract are presented in the table below. Just like the `eosio.bios` sample contract there are a few actions which are not implemented at the contract level (`newaccount`, `updateauth`, `deleteauth`, `linkauth`, `unlinkauth`, `canceldelay`, `onerror`, `setabi`, `setcode`), they are just declared in the contract so they will show in the contract's ABI and users will be able to push those actions to the chain via the account holding the 'eosio.system' contract, but the implementation is at the EOSIO core level. They are referred to as EOSIO native actions.
