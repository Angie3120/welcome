# Set up a cookie to assist in getting started with smart contracts

## Setup a development directory, stick to it.
You're going to need to pick a directory to work from, it's suggested to create a `contracts` directory somewhere on your local drive.
```shell
mkdir contracts
cd contracts
```

## Enter your local directory below.
Get the path of that directory and save it for later, as you're going to need it, you can use the following command to get your absolute path.
```
pwd
```

Enter the absolute path to your contract directory below, and it will be inserted throughout the documentation to make your life a bit easier. _This functionality requires cookies_
