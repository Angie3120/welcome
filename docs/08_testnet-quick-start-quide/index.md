# **Abstract**

This guide is for users who intend to use the EOSIO Testnet for building blockchain applications on EOSIO. This guide also supports EOSIO-based documentation tutorials that use the Testnet to perform various smart contract operations including pushing permission-based actions.

The EOSIO Testnet is a web application that you can access using your login credentials. You don't have to download binaries to install the system as no external installation and configuration are required.

# Getting Started with Testnet
This chapter provides instructions for registering a new EOSIO Testnet developer account and steps to log in to the Testnet web interface.

When you register on the EOSIO Testnet, we will create a new developer account for you - a login credential for you to log into the Testnet. With the new developer account, a new blockchain account is also provisioned to interact with the blockchain by deploying smart contracts or pushing actions.

[[info | Note]]
| The developer account is only used for login purposes and should not be confused with a blockchain account.

## Testnet Login
If you already have a Developer Testnet account, log in at [EOSIO Testnet Login](https://testnet.eos.io/user#login).

# Blockchain Account Configuration
This section provides instructions on creating new blockchain accounts within the Testnet and additional administrative actions such as requesting new Temporary Network Tokens (TNTs) for staking and unstaking system resources.

An account is a collection of authorizations, is stored on the blockchain, and is used to identify a sender/recipient. The flexible authorization structure of an account enables it to be owned either by an individual or group of individuals dependant on how permissions are configured. An account sends or receives a valid transaction to the blockchain.

For more information on EOSIO accounts and associated permissions, see the [Accounts and Permissions](../04_protocol/04_accounts_and_permissions.md) page on the [_EOSIO Developers Portal_](https://developers.eos.io/).

## Create New Account
The EOSIO Testnet provisions a new EOSIO blockchain account every time you sign up for a new EOSIO Testnet developer account. If you require more EOSIO blockchain accounts, follow the steps below.

**Complete the following steps to create a new account:**

1. Log in to [EOSIO Testnet](https://testnet.eos.io/user#login) and navigate to **Blockchain Accounts** from the top navigation menu.

     ![new account](./images/new-bc-account-1.png)
2. To create a new account, click the **create another account** button (outlined in red below) next to the existing account name in the drop-down menu.

      ![new account](./images/new-bc-account-2.png)

[[info | Note]]
| You can see your existing blockchain accounts in the drop-down menu.

**Result**

The previous action creates a new blockchain account as show below:

   ![new account](./images/new-bc-account-3.png)

After creating new accounts, request Temporary Network Tokens (TNTs) as outlined in the next section *Request Tokens*.

## Request Tokens
Temporary Network Tokens (TNTs) are the native tokens of the EOSIO Testnet. By default, each account contains 32 TNTs. Tokens allow you to get more system resources on Testnet to deploy contracts, interact with smart contracts, and store data on the blockchain.

**To request new TNTs**, In the **Balances (TNT)** block, click the **Request Tokens** button to replenish your account by 10 tokens.

 ![request tokens](./images/request-tokens.png)

**Result**

This action replenishes your account by 10 tokens and disables the **Request Tokens** button for the next 60 minutes as show below:

   ![request tokens](./images/request-tokens-disabled.png)

[[info | Note]]
| TNTs are replenished every hour by the system. After requesting the first set of tokens, wait for 60 minutes before requesting another round of tokens.

## Buy and Stake System Resources

For more information on staking, see the [Staking on EOSIO Based Blockchains](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.contracts/latest/key-concepts/stake) section on the *EOSIO Developers Portal*.

Complete the following steps to buy and stake system resources:

1. On the **Blockchain Accounts** page, scroll down to **Request Resources**.
2. To buy **RAM**, enter the amount in bytes and click on the **Get RAM** button.
3. To stake **CPU**, enter the TNT amount and click the **Stake** button.
4. To stake **NET**, enter the TNT amount and click the **Stake** button.
