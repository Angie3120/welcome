# Prepare Your Development Environment

A local development environment in the context of EOSIO is an environment (local machine) where you satisfy the system requirements and install the EOSIO software along with the related dependencies. When the the local development environment is prepared, you will be able to run a local blockchain instance (running nodeos) and deploy smart contracts.

The following topics will guide you to set up your local development environment to build and deploy smart contracts:

1. [System Requirements](05_system_requirements.md): System prerequisites to prepare your local development environment
2. [Install EOSIO Binaries](10_installing-eosio-binaries.md): Steps to install EOSIO pre-built binaries
3. [Install the CDT](20_installing-eosiocdt.md): Steps to install EOSIO Contracts Development Kit (CDT) which will act as a compiler
4. [Create Development Wallet](30_development-wallet.md): Steps to create development wallet to store key pairs 
5. [Initialize Keosd and Nodeos](40_running-nodeos-keosd.md): Steps to start `Keosd` and `Nodeos` 
6. [Create Development Accounts](50_create-dev-accounts.md): Steps to create you first EOSIO blockchain accounts for smart contracts
