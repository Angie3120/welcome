## Install the EOSIO platform
To get started as quickly as possible we recommend using pre-built binaries. Building from source is a more advanced option but will set you back an hour or more and you may encounter build errors. See the [Installation Guides](../10_installation-guides) for details on how to install the required EOSIO components.
