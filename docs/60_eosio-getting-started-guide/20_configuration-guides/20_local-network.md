A local single node testnet is a great place to start, but a blockchain running on a single node is not much of a blockchain. To run many nodes locally see the guides listed below. Often multi node testnets will be used for advanced development and testing giving a more realistci blockchain environment. Other uses for a a multi node testnet are benchmarking, optimization and experimentation, or to increase your knowledge.
