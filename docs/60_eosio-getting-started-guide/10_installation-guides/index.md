There are two ways to install and use the EOSIO software:

* [Install EOSIO Prebuilt Binaries](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/install/install-prebuilt-binaries)
* [Build EOSIO from Source](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/install/build-from-source/index)

[[info]]
| If you are new to EOSIO, it is recommended that you install the [EOSIO Prebuilt Binaries](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/install/install-prebuilt-binaries), then proceed to the [Getting Started](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-home/docs/) section of the [EOSIO Developer Portal](https://developers.eos.io/). If you are an advanced developer, a block producer, or no binaries are available for your platform, you may need to [Build EOSIO from source](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/install/build-from-source/index) instead.
