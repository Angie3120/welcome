# Welcome
Welcome to the EOSIO platform. This getting started guide will quickly show you how to use the EOSIO platform.

The EOSIO platform is made up of the following components and toolchain:

1. `nodeos`:  the core EOSIO node daemon that can be configured with plugins to run a node. Example uses are block production, dedicated API endpoints, and local development.
2. `cleos`: the command line interface to interact with the blockchain and to manage wallets.
3. `keosd`: the component that securely stores EOSIO keys in wallets.
4. `EOSIO.CDT`: toolchain for WebAssembly (Wasm)  and a set of tools to facilitate smart contract writing for the EOSIO platform.

In the getting started guide we introduce you to concepts, tools and SDK's you will use to build robust blockchain solutions. 

# Blockchain Terminology in an EOSIO World
You can find EOSIO definitions in our [Glossary](https://developers.eos.io/welcome/latest/glossary/index)

# Configuration Guides

## Plugin Guides
Use plugins to extend, or specialise, the behaviour of nodeos and kleosd:

* [Nodeos Plugins](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/nodeos/plugins/index) 
* [Keosd PLugins](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/keosd/plugins/index)

## Development Environment
Smart contracts are written in C++. Any editor or IDE can be used to create a smart contract. The EOSIO.CDT provides eosio libraries and tools used to compile the smart contract before it can be deployed to the blockchain.   

### Example Editors and IDEs

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/)
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
- [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/oxygen/1a/eclipse-ide-cc-developers)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Alternatively, you can use IDEs specifically developed for EOSIO:

- [EOS Studio](https://www.eosstudio.io/)

# Protocol Guides
In this section we describe the base components and protocols used in the EOSIO platform.

## Core
`EOSIO Core` provides the basic building blocks for the `system` layer. The `core` implementation is open source.

The core protocols are:

1. [Consensus Protocol](01_consensus_protocol.md)
2. [Transactions Protocol](02_transactions_protocol.md)
3. [Network or Peer to Peer Protocol](03_network_peer_protocol.md)
4. [Accounts and Permissions](04_accounts_and_permissions.md)

## System
Core blockchain features such as consensus, fee schedules, account creation and modification, token economics, block producer registration, voting, multi-sig, etc are implemented with smart contracts which are deployed on an EOSIO blockchain. These smart contracts are known as `system contracts` or the `system` layer. 

1. [eosio.bios](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.contracts/latest/action-reference/eosio.bios)
2. [eosio.system](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.contracts/latest/action-reference/eosio.system)
3. [eosio.msig](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.contracts/latest/action-reference/eosio.msig)
4. [eosio.token](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.contracts/latest/action-reference/eosio.token)
5. [eosio.wrap](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.contracts/latest/action-reference/eosio.wrap)

The `system` layer also includes:

1. [System accounts](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#system-contracts-system-accounts-priviledged-accounts)
2. [RAM](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#ram)

# Hello World
Let's start with a simple smart contract producing the traditional "hello world." The [Hello World](./03_smart-contract-development/01_hello-world.md) tutorial will guide you step by step in building a simple smart contract and deploying the smart contract to an EOSIO blockchain. 

# Testnet
The EOSIO Testnet is a web application that you can access using your login credentials. You don't have to download binaries to install the system as no external installation or configuration is required. The EOSIO Testnet is Block.one's offical testnet and uses the latest EOSIO software.

* [EOSIO Testnet](https://testnet.eos.io/) Block.one's official EOSIO Testnet.
