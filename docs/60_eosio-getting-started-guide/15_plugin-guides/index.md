Plugins extend the core functionality implemented in each tool. Plugins published by block.one are available in the standard binaries installation. 

There are currently two EOSIO components which use plugins:

* [Nodeos Plugins](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/nodeos/plugins/index)
* [Keosd Plugins](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/keosd/plugins/index) 

To use additional community plugins requires you to recompile the binaries linked to the appropriate plugin see [Community Plugin List](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/plugins/COMMUNITY.md) for more information.
