Plugins extend the core functionality implemented in nodeos. Some plugins are mandatory, such as chain_plugin, net_plugin, and producer_plugin, which reflect the modular design of nodeos. The other plugins are optional as they provide nice to have features, but non-essential for the nodes operation.
