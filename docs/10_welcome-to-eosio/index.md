## Welcome to the EOSIO Developers Portal! 

Thank you for visiting us! The EOSIO Developers Portal is a documentation platform that hosts a rich array of technical product documentation resources. These resources empower developers to create enterprise-grade, secure, and scalable blockchain applications using the EOSIO software.

Are you a new entrant to the blockchain space? If yes, no worries, we have onboarding content to help orient you to the EOSIO development environment and try your first basic smart contract! If you are a seasoned blockchain developer enthusiast, we offer you a variety of documentation assets specially created for your consumption.

This portal supports your EOSIO learning and development journey through the following curated technical documentation resources:

* EOSIO Concepts: Learn the core concepts of the EOSIO platform
* EOSIO Protocols: Gain a deeper understanding of the various protocols such as [Accounts and Permissions](../60_eosio-getting-started-guide/40_protocol-guides/40_accounts_and_permissions.md) implemented in the EOSIO platform
* EOSIO Getting Started: Orient yourself with the EOSIO development environment and basic smart contract development. Best suited for new developers onboarding the EOSIO blockchain ecosystem
* EOSIO Guides: Access EOSIO component guides and learn how to install, configure, and use the individual components in your EOSIO developer environment
* API Reference: Browse our API catalogue and discover what kinds of APIs we provide
Glossary: Browse through a curated list of EOSIO terminologies. 

And more!

## Doc Page Design

To become familiar with the EOSIO Developers Portal design, standard page layout, and navigation, see the [Portal Design](../40_portal-design) section.

## EOSIO is Open Source

The EOSIO Developers Portal generates documentation from source files hosted on Github! All documentation on developers.eos.io is open sourced and designed to allow community contributions. We leverage the power of open source to deliver trusted content to support your EOSIO onboarding and advanced development journey.

## A Bit of History

The Developer Relations team (responsible for authoring the EOSIO developer documentation) spearheaded an audacious endeavor on the EOSIO product documentation spectrum. Due to the inherently intricate nature of the EOSIO software platform, the Developer Relations team collaborated closely with the EOSIO engineering division to receive authoritative, first hand knowledge and inputs from the creators of the platform. The Developer Relations team conducted a sweeping tech reconnaissance of the then docs-engineering collaboration framework and ideated an environment to foster productive collaboration with the internal engineering division and the external EOSIO developer community. We discarded the then-existing, proprietary CMS platform, and implemented a new docs toolchain where you produce documentation in the same ecosystem as code, in close proximity with the developers (Docs-as-Code). 

The Developer Relations team further executed a conscientious and concerted effort of designing, scaffolding, developing, and deploying the Developer Portal that generates developer documentation by parsing source files in GitHub. The finished documentation product incorporates updated information from internal developers as well as contributions from the EOSIO developer community.

## Fun Fact

Heard about the Github Archive Program? The endeavor to preserve open source software for future generations in case of an extinction-level event? 

The Github Archive program includes the EOSIO Project (which includes documentation commits) along with other open source projects like Linux, Android, nodeJS, GatsbyJS, Python, docker, Bitcoin, Postgres, and others. Therefore, the longevity of the EOSIO source code is guaranteed!
