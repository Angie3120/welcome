EOSIO based blockchains execute smart contracts which are written in `C++` and then compiled to `bytecode` using the `EOSIO Contract Development Toolkit` or `CDT.` The resulting `WebAssembly` or `WASM` files are then executed by a virtual stack machine (see [eos vm](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos-vm)). WASM is an emerging web standard with widespread support from Google, Microsoft, Apple, and industry leading companies.

Your development environment will require [installing the CDT](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/installation) to build the smart contract, a code editor, the ability to deploy a smart contract to a blockchain, and a running blockchain and accounts on that blockchain.

There are many options for setting up a development environment and in this section we discuss these options.
