To download all of the code, clone the `eos` repository and its submodules.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/EOSIO/eos --recursive

```
If a repository is cloned without the `--recursive` flag, the submodules can be cloned at a later time: 

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive

```
