`Nodeos` generally runs in two modes:
 - [Producing Node](doc:environment-producing-node)
 - [Non-Producing Node](doc:environment-non-producing-node)

`Producing Nodes` will connect to the peer to peer network and actively produce new blocks. `Non-Producing Nodes` will connect to the peer to peer network, however, in this mode `nodeos` does not actively produce new blocks, it will simply verify blocks and maintain a local copy of the blockchain. `Non-Producing Nodes` can be used for monitoring the blockchain.
