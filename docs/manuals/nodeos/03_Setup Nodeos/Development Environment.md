There are several ways to configure your development environment with Nodeos, which one you choose largely depends on what you are trying to achieve. Below are some practical options for you to explore.

{
  "title": "Local Single-Node Testnet"
}
[/block]
This is the go-to option for Smart Contract developers, aspiring Block Producers or Non-Producing Node operators. It has the most simple configuration with the least number of requirements.

[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Local Multi-Node Testnet"
}
[/block]
While this option can technically be used for smart contract development, it may be overkill. This is most beneficial for those who are working on aspects of Core Development, such as benchmarking, optimization and experimentation. It's also a good option for the curious and tinkerers amongst you.
