# Get Involved with EOSIO Documentation!

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the EOSIO platform documentation! We always welcome contributions from our community to make our docs better.

## How to Contribute

You can either submit a Pull Request for quick edits or file a new docs issue.

### Quick Edits
Quick edits allow for faster reporting of minor content issues from typographical errors to omissions.

Most of the pages on the EOSIO developer portal provide an **Edit** link which redirects you to the source file on Github. If you don't see the **Edit** button on the documentation page, that means the specific page is not available to be changed.

To make a quick edit:


1. Go to the specific page where you have identified an editorial need and click the **Edit** icon at the top right of the page.

2. Fork the repository to suggest changes. Click **Fork this repository**.

3. Make the suggested changes in the web editor using Markdown syntax. Click the **Preview changes** tab to see the preview of the content.
4. After suggesting your changes, scroll down to the bottom on the page. Enter a title and a description of the changes you made and click **Propose file change**.
5. Create a ***Pull Request*** by entering a title and a description. Click **Create pull request** to submit your suggestion to us.
