If you do not want to install on your local machine `EOSIO` binaries, or if you have other type of restrictions installing `EOSIO` binaries, you can try `EOSIO` in a browser. This approach is powered by Gitpod.io and Docker, and it provides developers with a personal single-node `EOSIO` blockchain for development and testing purposes.

You can give it a try in a matter of seconds right now by accessing this [link](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-web-ide) and you can read more details about it [here](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-web-ide).
