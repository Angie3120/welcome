content_title: EOSIO Quickstart Web IDE for decentralized applications
---

Powered by Gitpod.io and Docker, `EOSIO Quickstart Web IDE`, provides developers with a personal 
single-node `EOSIO` blockchain for development and testing purposes without a need of going through 
advanced local environment setup. It also includes an example application with a smart contract 
and web frontend, connected to the blockchain. Developers can also use `EOSIO` tools like `cleos` and 
`eosio.cdt` straight out of the box. This project requires zero installation on the user's machine. 
All code is stored and managed on the developer's personal GitHub account, with the changes saved 
automatically.

We built this project with ease of use and simplicity in mind. It can be used by new developers 
trying out or learning `EOSIO`, as well as advanced developers and teams. It is especially useful 
in the environments where users don't have full control over the systems they work on (universities, 
banks, government organizations, etc.) or when they have lower-than-required computer specs to run 
`EOSIO` locally.
