This section introduces you to the EOSIO smart contracts development workflow. You build your first basic Hello World smart contract to lay the groundwork to implement additional smart contracts such as token contracts, address book, payable actions, and more. You will gain advanced understanding on how data persistence works in the context of a smart contract and also how inline actions are implemented in a smart contract. 

### Before you begin
To get started as quickly as possible we recommend using pre-built binaries. Building from source is a more advanced option but will set you back an hour or more and you may encounter build errors. See the [Getting Started Guide](../30_getting-started-guide) for details on how to install and set up the required EOSIO components.

The following list provides topics to get your started with smart contract development workflow:

* [Hello World](10_hello-world.md): How to build, deploy and use a simple ["Hello World"](10_hello-world.md) smart contract
* [Deploy, Issue and Transfer Tokens](20_deploy-issue-and-transfer-tokens.md): How to use the eosio.token smart contract
* [Understanding ABI Files](30_understanding-ABI-files.md): How ABI files work and what they are 
* [Data Peristence](40_data-persistence.md): How to store data on the blockchain, with a single index
* [Secondary Indices](50_secondary-indices.md): How to store data on the blockchain, with muliple indices
* [Adding inline Actions](60_adding-inline-actions.md): How to call actions in your smart contract
* [Inline Actions to external contracts](70_inline-action-to-external-contract.md): How to call actions in other smart contracts
* [Linking custom permissions](80_linking-custom-permission.md): How to set up custom permissions on a smart contract
* [Payable Actions](90_payable-actions.md): How to be paid for calling smart contract actions
