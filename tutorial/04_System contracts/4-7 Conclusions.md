The five system contracts described in this tutorial: `eosio.bios`, `eosio.system`, `eosio.wrap`, `eosio.msig`, `eosio.token` are provided by Block.one as samples of possible implementations of an instance of a blockchain based on the EOSIO platform. They can be tailored to meet specific business requirements and thus give users the ability to create various EOSIO based blockchains, each with its governing rules and token economies.
